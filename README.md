# AAI-520 Final Team Project: Multi-Agent Financial Analysis System

**Group 8** - jjustice, pwang

An autonomous Investment Research Agent. Given a stock symbol, it plans its own
research steps, calls tools to gather market data and news, drafts an analysis,
critiques that draft, and refines it. Notes from each run are kept so later runs
on the same symbol start better informed.

Everything runs locally. No API keys, no paid services.

## What it demonstrates

**Agent functions**

- **Plans** its research steps for a given stock symbol
- **Uses tools** dynamically: prices, financials, news, and retrieval
- **Self-reflects** by scoring its own draft and acting on the critique
- **Learns** across runs by keeping short per-symbol notes

**Workflow patterns**

- **Prompt chaining**: Ingest News -> Preprocess -> Classify -> Extract -> Summarize
- **Routing**: send content to an earnings, news, or market specialist
- **Evaluator-Optimizer**: generate, evaluate, refine on feedback

## Stack

| Piece | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Language model | `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`, run locally via Hugging Face `transformers` |
| Sentiment | BERT sentiment `pipeline` |
| Entity extraction | spaCy NER and PoS tagging |
| Retrieval | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings in a FAISS index |
| Market data | Yahoo Finance via `yfinance` |
| Environment | Python 3.13, managed by `uv` |

## Setup

Requires macOS or Linux. Run once after cloning:

```bash
./init.sh
```

That installs `uv` if missing, then builds `.venv` from `pyproject.toml` and
`uv.lock` so every teammate gets identical versions.

The spaCy `en_core_web_sm` model is pinned in `pyproject.toml` and installed by
`uv sync`, so no separate download is needed. The NLTK data sets are downloaded
at runtime and are not covered by `uv sync`, so fetch them once:

```bash
uv run python -c "import nltk; [nltk.download(p) for p in ('punkt_tab','averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng','stopwords','wordnet')]"
```

The first notebook run also downloads the Phi-3-mini weights, roughly 7.6 GB,
into `~/.cache/huggingface`. That happens once.

## Running the notebook

Open `src/investment_research_agent.ipynb` and select the `./.venv/bin/python`
interpreter. In VS Code that is the interpreter picker at the top right.

For Jupyter Lab in the browser instead:

```bash
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```

```

## Development

Component logic is built as plain `.py` files in `src/scratch/` so it can be unit
tested, then assembled into the notebook for submission:

```bash
uv run pytest src/scratch/                       # unit tests (no model, no network)
uv run python src/scratch/smoke_llm.py           # manual LLM check (loads the model)
uv run python src/scratch/assemble_notebook.py   # emit paste-ready notebook cells
```

## Contributing

`schedule.md` holds the task plan, deadlines, and owners. Two rules matter:

- Develop in your own `src/scratch/` files. Only one person edits
  `investment_research_agent.ipynb` at a time, otherwise the JSON merge
  conflicts are unresolvable.
- Run **Restart and Clear All Outputs** before committing. Outputs are kept only
  on the final submission run.

Python follows PEP 8.
